## Installing libraries

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Features

Annotated with who did what (E: Esther Chevalier, S: Sören Selbach)
### Procedural

- Procedural ground using fractalized Perlin noise (both)
- Procedural water movement (E)

### Textures

- Diffuse mapping (both)
- Normal mapping (S)
- Displacement Mapping (S)
- Specular mapping (S)
- Cube mapping (S)
    - Environment mapping
    - Skybox

### Shading

- Phong shading (both)
- Fog (S)

### Animation
- Keyframe animations (E)
- Skinning (E)

## Possible improvements
### Make it an actual game
- Character movement
- Obstacles
- Infinite bridge/ground (⇒ tileable perlin noise)
### Rendering effects
- Ambient occlusion
- Shadows
- Etc.
### Performance
- Less detail in ground and water further away from camera
